## Concept
A personal website where I can list projects I've worked on,
share my interests and simplify how people can reach out to me.

At any point, visitors can switch between two versions of the website -
one with a focus on real life and another with a focus on my digital life
(where I go by VicLourenco).

## Implementation
The website will be mostly built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS,
but I'll take advantage of Bootstrap's features here and there
(as required by the project proposal).
